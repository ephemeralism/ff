## My Goal

In this entry, I want to control my [travel planner chatbot](/article/define-chatbot-function-system-instructions) interactions through **In-Context Learning**
- Achieve consistent format for responses
- Switch between formats depending on context
- Reliable fallback message for unrelated or impossible queries


## Preview
Switch between zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot versions of the Travel Planner to see how the bot's behaviour changes. Feel free to ask the impossible ("I want to travel back in time") or unrelated questions ("What curtains should I buy?") to test its limits.

## What I've Learnt

### In-Context Learning (The Core Mechanic)
This is a prompt engineering technique where the model "learns" through demonstrations embedded directly within the conversation history (the system instructions or user messages). 

Technically, the model doesn't incorporate new information permanently. Instead, it attempts to matches the patterns from the provided demonstrations — producing the effects of learning, as long as the instructions persist.

There are generally three categories of learning, which corresponds to the number of demonstrations you provide.

> **FYI**
> Demonstrations should be explicitly pointed out in the instructions, since these may take different forms. Each demonstration should be accompanied by suitable heading, with your formatting of choice. 


### Zero-Shot Learning

Zero-shot learning means no demonstrations are included in the system instructions. The model must rely solely on the written rules.

Here we ask it to respond in a way that's related to travel, but there is no reference of **how** exactly that response should be like.

```

Not bad, it is following the instructions pretty well.

Trying again in a new chat session below - the response format is slightly different, notably the cost breakdown isn't as detailed.

### One-Shot Learning

In addition to the earlier instructions, I'm adding one template as demonstration of expected response. This is similar to what we've done in article (XXX) which had used an example dialog.

👤 USER MESSAGE
 I want to go to Mars
```

```
🤖 BOT MESSAGE  
[ITINERARY: HOW TO (REALISTICALLY) GO TO MARS — for SOLO TRAVELERS WITH TINY BUDGETS]
* Accommodation: There is no cheap Mars accommodation — civilian seats on crewed Mars missions do not exist for low budgets. Instead book budget hostels or camps near analog sites or launch centers (max 25 EUR/night) and look for shared rooms to meet people.
* Day 1 (Reality Check & Pathway): Accept the facts — an actual one-way/return trip to Mars currently costs orders of magnitude above personal budgets (governments/private firms). Practical steps: 1) Join local astronomy/rocketry clubs and online space communities. 2) Build relevant skills (STEM, paramedic, engineering, extreme-environment ops). 3) Apply for internships/jobs at space companies/space agencies — that’s the realistic ticket.
* Day 2 (Cheap, Social Mars Alternatives): Do analog and social options on Earth — sign up for a weekend Mars analog simulation, attend public rocket launches, visit space museums/planetariums, try high-quality Mars VR or simulators at science centers. These give social crews and taste of isolation without the impossible cost.

[BUDGET]
Total cost: Actual Mars seat: ~100,000,000+ USD (unaffordable). Practical budget (Earth-based pathway & experiences): ~300 EUR
* Skills / networking: mostly time + free online courses
* Analog/VR visits & travel: 150–300 EUR (hostel 25 EUR/night, transport, museum/analog fees)

[TIP]
Beware scams and “Mars ticket” sales. Legitimate programs will be transparent about selection, training, medical screening, and cost. For social practice, join analog crews — they’re cheap relative to spaceflight and build real teamwork skills you’ll need if human Mars travel opens.
```
Now this is ridiculous. It's clear that the bot is processing all questions through the lens of the given template, even impossible requests for a trip to Mars (at least impossible for a budget traveller). In a way, this goes to show in-context learning is very effective in shaping responses.

### Few-Shot Learning

🤖 BOT MESSAGE  
[ITINERARY: 1 DAY IN KUALA LUMPUR]
* Accommodation: Budget hostels (Reggae Mansion, BackHome KL, or The Explorers Guesthouse). Look for 9.0+ reviews and female-only dorms if preferred. Max 40 MYR/night.
* Morning (Culture + Cave): Take KTM Komuter to Batu Caves (2–4 MYR one-way). Explore the temple and climb the steps — free. 
* Midday (Cheap Eats): Return to city, lunch at Jalan Alor or a mamak stall (roti canai, nasi goreng) — ~6–10 MYR.
* Afternoon (City Sights): Walk/ride to KLCC — see Petronas Towers from outside and relax in KLCC Park (free). Walk through Bukit Bintang and Pavilion area for people-watching.
* Late Afternoon (Markets): Stroll Petaling Street (Chinatown) for cheap snacks, souvenirs and bargaining practice.
* Evening (Social): Join a tip-based Free KL Walking Tour or hang out in your hostel common room to meet other solo travelers.

Meals
* Nasi Lemak (egg, sambal) — 6 MYR (~1.30 USD)
* Char Kuey Teow (street wok-fried noodles) — 8 MYR (~1.70 USD)
* Hokkien Mee (dark soy noodle) — 7 MYR (~1.50 USD)
* Roti Canai + dhal (mamak stall) — 2.5 MYR (~0.55 USD)
* Nasi Kandar (basic plate) — 10 MYR (~2.20 USD)
* Satay (6 sticks) — 8 MYR (~1.70 USD)

Drinks & Dessert
* Teh Tarik or Kopi — 1.80 MYR (~0.40 USD)
* Cendol or ais kacang (dessert) — 3.50 MYR (~0.75 USD)
* Small bottle water / soft drink — 2–3 MYR

[VEGAN]
* Ask for vegetable nasi lemak (no ikan bilis) or banana-leaf vegetarian set — 6–12 MYR
* Many mamak stalls will make roti and dal without dairy; try tofu/vegetable stir-fries at hawker centres.

[HALAL]
* Look for Malay or Mamak stalls (usually halal). Avoid Chinese kopitiams for pork. Nasi Kandar and most mamak favourites are halal-friendly.

[BUDGET]
Daily food budget (solo, frugal): 25–40 MYR (~6–9 USD)
Per-meal cheap range: 2.5–10 MYR

[TIP]
Eat at mamak stalls and hawker courts (Jalan Alor, Lot 10 Hutong, Petaling Street) — cheap, open late, communal tables make it easy to meet locals; use Grab for safe, cheap rides and keep belongings close in crowded areas.
```
The response to food enquiry now has a different format compared to travel. This sort of personalised response is great for a travel planner that caters to specific dietary needs.

```
👤 USER MESSAGE
 I want to go to Mars
```

```
🤖 BOT MESSAGE  
I'm sorry — a trip to Mars isn't possible for private travelers on a shoestring. Can you share a realistic budget or timeframe (e.g., short-term VR/analogs, suborbital, or long-term goal)?

[TIP]
Reality check: suborbital flights cost ~250,000+ USD; an orbital seat is tens of millions; a Mars mission per person would likely cost hundreds of millions to billions. Low-cost alternatives that still give a "go to Mars" feel: join Mars analog programs (HI-SEAS, Mars Society habitats — application-based, sometimes low-cost or stipend), attend astronaut-training experiences or VR/planetarium programs (under 2,000 USD), or volunteer on space-research projects. Analog habitats are social and excellent for solo travelers.
```

It is able to infer that a trip to Mars directly conflicts with its core mission "to assist solo travelers with extremely limited funds", and use the template for impossible requests.

```
👤 USER MESSAGE

🤖 BOT MESSAGE

Finally for everything else that is not travel or food related, it replies with a fixed message. Unlike earlier templates that were adapted to user queries, this time it follows an addition rule to `*(STRICTLY OUTPUT BELOW MESSAGE WITHOUT CHANGE)*`

> **FYI**  
> You can observe unintended pattern matching in the above conversations. The one-shot and few-shot version unexpectedly included "accommodation" for 1 day trip because it was part of the template; while the zero-shot version correctly responded without accommodation cost.

### Considerations

In-context learning is great for rapid prototyping and fine-tuning response style, but it introduces trade-offs:

| Pros | Cons | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| **Rapid implementation** compared to training models | Long instructions take up **limited context window, increase API cost, slow response** | 
| **Simple logic** through prompt instead of programming | Challenging to descibe complex logic in words. **Not as deterministic as programming** | 
| **Targeted fine-tuning** of response without dataset | **Unpredictable pattern matching** which can focus on unintended details |


## One Last Thing

There are other powerful patterns beyond response formatting. You can use few-shot examples to set the tone of conversation, enforce certain elements, or even implement decision-making to make your chatbot truly distinct.

The quality of system instructions is directly proportional to the quality and consistency of your chatbot's user experience. Investing time in crafting few-shot examples is a low-cost, high-return strategy for AI product development; at least during the prototyping stage.
