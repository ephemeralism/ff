import ChatbotV2AIComponent from 'chatbot-v2-ai-component.astro';

## My Goal
Now that I have a [basic chatbot](/article/build-chatbot-3-message-roles), I want to explore a few different functions it can take on:
- a domain-specific assistant (Travel Planner)
- a well-known character (Yoda from Star Wars)
- a specialised agent or service (Database Query Generator)
- a detailed persona (Undead Pirate Captain)

My goal is to explore the how **System Instructions** changes the bot's behaviour.

## Preview
Switch between the bots and see how they react differently to the same user message. Each bot is running the same base model but has a unique set of System Instructions (the content of the System prompt) to define its function. Feel free to edit the system instructions to your liking.

`### IDENTITY ###
You are Captain LeChuck, an undead pirate captain from the 17th century sailing with a crew of escaped monkeys on the Carribean Sea. 

### INSTRUCTIONS ###
1. Your goal is to find "Big Whoop" a legendary treasure.
2. You talk like a salty pirate with hints to your undead nature and monkey crew.
3. You will curse if user mentions topics after 17th century or modern jargon. 
4. Respond with varying length that matches user message. Avoid overly lengthy responses.

### EXAMPLE DIALOG ###
By the fires of hell, move that cannon, ye blinking simpleton! Are ye waiting for the powder to dry? I want a shot across their bow now, or I'll feed your scrawny tail to the nearest man-eating shark! Quick, ye doleful chimp`
        }}/>


## What I've Learnt

### System Prompt

The system role is the highest-authority command in the conversation. When the LLM sees a conflict â€” for instance, between the user asking it to break character and the system telling it to maintain character â€” the system almost always takes precedence.


### Instructions

Instructions refer to the content that you set in system prompt, which acts as your command to the chatbot. 

A simple instruction like "You are a legal assistant" is a good start, but for complex, reliable agents, you need to break the instructions into clear components.

#### Components

Here are some common ones that I've observed 

| Component | Description | Example | 
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| Identity | Define the primary skill set or identity | You are Captain LeChuck, an undead pirate captain from the 17th century |
| Context / Domain | Specify the knowledge area or environment the bot operates within | sailing with a crew of escaped monkeys on the Carribean sea |
| Goal | Define the primary purpose or objective to achieve | Your goal is to find "Big Whoop" a legendary treasure |
| Style | Communication style or persona that the bot takes on | You talk like a salty pirate with hints to your undead nature and monkey crew |
| Constraints | Limit specific actions, topics, or language | You do not comprehend topics after 17th century or modern jargon, and get irritated instead |
| Output | Define the structure of the response | Respond with varying length that matches user message. Avoid overly lengthy responses | 
| Examples | References for possible inputs and desired output from the model | "By the fires of hell, move that cannon, ye blinking simpleton! Are ye waiting for the powder to dry? I want a shot across their bow now, or I'll feed your scrawny tail to the nearest man-eating shark! Quick, ye doleful chimp |

Constraints are particularly effective in controlling your bot:
- Positive constraints defines what to do or what the output must include. E.g. "Limit the response to three sentences.", "Use simple, layman's terms exclusively."
- Negative constraints defines what to avoid or what the output must not include. E.g. "Don't be too long.", "Do not use technical jargon." 

> **FYI**
> The general recommendation in prompt engineering is to rephrase negative constraints as positive ones for better reliability. I say choose the version that more specific, less prone to ambiguity 

### Structured Instructions
Structured instructions are best-practice method of writing prompts using explicit formatting on clearly defined components to guide the model's thought process and output. It moves beyond a simple, conversational query by imposing a formal architecture on the prompt text itself

#### Formatting

Delimiters are characters that seperates or emphasises different components for your model's understanding. Markdown and XML formats are commonly used as these are the same content format that models are trained on; Markdown for web and XML for code. 

Markdown is a readable and token efficient format. OpenAI and Google models have a preference for this.
- Lists: Use numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) for sequential steps or rules, and bullet points (- or *) for key features or required outputs.
- Emphasis: Use bolding (\*\*text\*\*) or capitalization to highlight extremely important constraints or keywords.
- Code Blocks: For specifying the required output format (like JSON or Python code), use code blocks (triple backticks)

XML format is a more robust format with unambiguous delimiters that reinforces intent (e.g. `<constraints></constraints>`). It is preferred by Anthropic Claude, also compatible with OpenAI and Google models.

I use Markdown for better readablility here but recommend XML for production use. 

> **FYI**  
> Consistent use of delimiters, especially XML format helps prevent "prompt injection" where a malicious user tries to override your system instructions with their own 

## Example

This is an example of structured instructions containing multiple instructional components, formatted with Markdown. You can organise the instructions in different ways to emphasise different aspects.
